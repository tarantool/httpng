# HTTPNG module for Tarantool

https://tarantool.io/en/

Based on libh2o from H2O HTTP Server (https://h2o.examp1e.net/)

Implementation is not yet finished - there is no graceful shutdown
or reload, there is no logging.

At the moment it listens on 0.0.0.0 at configured port
(default is 8080). TLS only, key/certificate filenames are hardcoded.

API is not yet finalized (especially WebSockets), you can use examples
as a documentation for now.

Note that H2O implementation of large POST/PUT requests handling is
inefficient and prone to DoS, you can use max_body_len parameter
(defaults to 1 MiB) to limit the impact.

Thank you for your interest in Tarantool!
